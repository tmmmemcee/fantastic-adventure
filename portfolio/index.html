        <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
        <p>My name is Tim McNamara and I am a recent graduate from the
          University of Minnesota. During my time at the
          <strong>University of Minnesota</strong>, I studied
          <strong>Applied Mathematics</strong> with a focus in
          <strong>computer specialization </strong>. </p>
          <p>I have a passion to continue learning and I push myself
            to find and solve new problems everyday.

        <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
        <p>Growing up I always excelled at Mathematics because of my
        <span style="background-color: lightblue; border: thin solid darkblue;">
        attention to detail and my ability to think creatively.</span>
        My father was
        a computer engineer so I have been around computers my entire life.
        While fear of life in a cubical detered me from early attempts at computer
        programming, I have since learned to enjoy utilizing the computational
        power that surrounds us to solve unique and complex problems.
