# SuperHero Sighting
I created a web application which Users can post SuperHero/Villian Sightings. Users can add SuperHeros/Villians into the system along with other pertenant information, 
such as, Superpowers, Super Organizations, and locations. The User can then report a Sighting of a SuperHero/Villian, which will be posted for all to see.

## Features
Uses Google Maps API to show map of Superhero Sighting

![SuperHeroSighting home page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmmmemcee/fantastic-adventure/master/Sighting/SuperHeroSighting.png)

Allows Users to upload photos of the SuperHero/Villian


## Details
A User must add the superhero or villian to the system if they have not already been entered into the system.
